HW1

Ch.1 #7

See handout of description of the states

Add the output HReset. This output reloads and starts the timer.

Note: LAg and LSpin do not set YTime = 0.

Also, you must use LPump to pump water into the washer
 (even though this is different than a real washer that uses the home’s water pressure to pump water in).
You also use LPUMP to pump water out of the washer.

On the ASM chart, you only write the outputs that are activated.
For example,
to fill the washer with HOT water, you show LPUMP, HFILL, HHOT
(not necessary together, but in the same state and in the same path in that state).

To fill the washer with cold water, you show LPUMP and HFILL
(not necessary together, but in the same state and same path in that state.

The reason they need to be in the same path is that:
HHOT does nothing by itself.
HFILL does nothing by itself.

NSTART is active low, so when it is high, it stops the actual timer; and
the washing machine should stop pumping or agitating, then when it goes back low,
it restarts the timer, and the washing machine resumes operation where it left off.

You only have to do the first 2 states: “Fill and Start Wash” & “Wash and Empty”
This must be a Mealy machine with conditional outputs.
Do not use any extra states.
Look at p.41 the Wiatrowski textbook for some ideas how to draw the ASM chart.
Remember that every state has to have a rectangle, and that any outputs inside
the rectange are always ON in that state (and might conflict with conditional
outputs in that state).  So you can only enter a state into the rectangle.
If a path is going up, it is leaving the state, so it has to connect to the rectangle
to come back in.
